\section{About the Author}\label{sec:about_author}

My name is \textsf{Jiuning Chen}, a third-year student in the School of Mathematical Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai. I'm currently doing research related to image processing, computer vision, convex optimization, and machine learning. It's worth noting that I got my bachelor's degree as a philosophy student, this experience makes me a good candidate to think about the future of \images{} ecosystem from a more generic and broader view -- I have good feelings about what needs improvement and what doesn't.\par

50+ hours per week can be guaranteed on this project since there's no other internship or vacation plan this summer. After GSoC, at least 20+ hours per week can be guaranteed to continue the long-term \images{} \version{1.0} project since I've passed the Ph.D. candidate examination in ECNU -- no compulsory work in the first academic year. \par

I learned \langjulia in Aug 2018 and become a contributor to \langjulia community since Oct 2018, and plan to make more contributions as a member of this community. Currently I'm one of the developers in \repoimagesgithubio{}.

\subsection*{Contribution to the community}
My main interest is to improve the \images, in the meantime, there are some small patches to \flux{} and \textsf{julia}. The major part of my contribution to \textsf{\juliaimages} is on issues: 25\% pull requests, 47\% issues, 19\% commits, 9\% code reviews. This is because I don't think \images{} is at its good status for new features until we pull this GSoC project off.

My previous PRs can help proving that I'm qualified to make progress on this project. Unless explicitly noted, all following PRs are non-trivial and merged.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhancement: \pullrequest{\julialang}{julia}{29626}\footnote{I only learned \langjulia{} for two months at that moment -- a proof of my good understanding on julia}\\

      this PR serves as a first attempt to \issue{\juliaimages}{\images}{790} -- Towards consistent style, part 2: a documentation guide\\
      not yet reviewed because the maintainers are busy lately
      }
    \item Patch(pending): \pullrequest{\fluxml}{\flux}{710}\\

    \item Patch: \pullrequest{\fluxml}{\flux}{371}\\
      {\small

I've also authored some related issues:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \issue{\juliaimages}{\images}{790} -- Towards consistent style, part 2: a documentation guide
  \item \issue{zygmuntszpak}{\imagebinarization}{24} -- Export limited number of symbols?
  \item \issue{\juliaimages}{\imagedistance}{7} -- Redesign the type hierarchy
  \item \issue{\juliaimages}{\images}{766} -- Use \mintinline{julia}{channelview} as possible as we can?
  \item \issue{\juliaimages}{\images}{765} -- Move \mintinline{julia}{difftype} to \imagecore
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Other Experiences}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Independently set up the whole self-hosted research platform from scratch for my supervisor's laboratory\\
        {\small
        5000 lines of markdown documentation is written by myself.
        }
      \item \textit{De facto} maintainer of the deep learning servers of the School of Mathematical Sciences, and that of a laboratory in Computer Sciences Department;
      \item Proudly created and maintained the \href{http://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~fli/}{homepage} of my supervisor.
      \item Head teaching assistant of courses: ``\href{http://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~fli/Teaching/DeepLearning/Fall2018/index.html}{Deep Learning and Action (Fall 2018)}''  and ``\href{http://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~fli/Teaching/DigitalImageProcessing/Spring2019/index.html}{Digital Image Processing (Spring 2019)}''.
  \end{itemize}


\subsection*{Self Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mathematics \& Image Processing (8/10)}: my current research is on image denoising using variational model and deep learning;
    \item \textbf{Linux (7/10)}: heavy usage of docker, bash, git and vim in my daily work to maintain the servers;
    \item \textbf{Matlab (8/10)}: the only programming language used throughout my early-stage of research;
    \item \textbf{Julia (7/10)}: fully understand and stick to the philosophy of \langjulia, but lack of real and large project experience;
    \item \textbf{Related packages (6/10)}: familiar with other image-processing packages but haven't dig into the source code of them yet.
\end{itemize}
